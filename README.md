# Hub-in-Cisco-Packet-Traser
The project “Hub” in Cisco Packet Tracer demonstrates a basic network topology using a hub to connect multiple computers in a LAN. All devices share the same communication channel, so data sent from one PC is broadcast to all connected devices. This project explains hub functionality, data transmission, collisions, and basic networking concepts.
